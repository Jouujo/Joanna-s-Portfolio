            <p class="about-text">
                Hi! Iâ€™m Joanna Chimalilo, a rising junior at Texas Tech University, where Iâ€™m double majoring in Computer Science and Economic Data Analysis. Iâ€™m passionate about software engineering, data science, and building projects that create meaningful impact.

Before transferring to Texas Tech, I completed my Associate of Science in General Studies (Pre-Engineering track) at South Plains College. While at SPC, I worked as a peer tutor for the STAR (Trio) Learning Center, supporting students with learning disabilities and those from low-income backgrounds. I also served as a resident assistant for SPC Residence Life, helping to foster a safe and welcoming environment on campus. During my time there, I also helped cofound the International Students' Association, a student-led group focused on building community and a sense of belonging for international students.

At Texas Tech, I currently work as a peer tutor at the TECHniques Center, where I support students with learning disabilitiesâ€”primarily in computer science. I also serve on the outreach committee for the Society of Women Engineers and volunteer with Learn to Be, a nonprofit offering free academic support to underserved Kâ€“12 students across the U.S. Additionally, Iâ€™m an Engineering Ambassador for the Whitacre College of Engineering, where I help represent the college at events and support prospective students.

Outside of tech, I love mentoring, building community, reading, and constantly learning new things.</p>

            <h3>NestHub</h3>
            <p>NestHub is a resource discovery platform built for immigrants in Texas, offering real-time listings for housing, job openings, food assistance, and local community support. I contributed to backend and data workflows, using Python and BeautifulSoup to scrape and structure public data. On the frontend, we used React to create a clean, responsive UI, with designs prototyped in Figma.

                We also implemented a user contribution feature, allowing new resources to be submitted and reviewed. NestHub won the Best DEI Hack at Black Wings Hacks 2024 and was inspired by our teamâ€™s shared experiences as immigrants and women of color.</p>

I uncovered key trends around product engagement and usage, and presented actionable insights to cross-functional teams across marketing, product, and engineering â€” helping inform future feature development and roadmap decisions.</p>

              <p>Developed a multi-strategy trading bot for the UChicago 2025 Trading Competition, focused on real-time market simulation across five assets. The bot used gRPC to interface with the competition exchange and integrated structured news to support algorithmic trading decisions.

                I contributed to the design of risk-aware trading strategies, including smart order execution, momentum-based allocation, and dynamic short-covering logic. The system was built in Python and deployed on a single virtual machine, with a Flask-based dashboard (Phoenixhood) for live monitoring of portfolio performance and order activity.</p>
