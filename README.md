# Joanna Chimalilo's Portfolio 🌸

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site was fully designed and developed by me using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — no frameworks, no templates.

It’s a space to showcase who I am, what I’ve built, and what I’m passionate about.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML** – for structuring the page
- **CSS** – for all layout + pastel-themed styling
- **JavaScript** – for interactivity (typewriter effect, custom chatbot, scroll behavior)
- **FontAwesome** – for icons (LinkedIn, GitHub, Devpost)
- **Google Fonts** – `Quicksand` and `Courier New` for modern + typewriter vibes

## Key Features

### Smooth Scrolling Navigation

- **InternTrackr** (coming soon)

### Research & Other Projects  
Includes my involvement in research programs (CICF, GradMAP), side projects, and fun data explorations.

###  Resume Download  
A custom button to download or view my latest resume.
